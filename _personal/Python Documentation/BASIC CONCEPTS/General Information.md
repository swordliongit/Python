	1. Whitespace counts as a character inside strings
	2. empty string returns False
	3. a and b: if a is False then b won't be evaluated
	4. a or b:  if a is True then b won't be evaluated
	5. objects are passed as references to the functions
	6. floating points are approximations so 0.1+0.2 is not equal to 0.3
	7. None means null
	8. ... -> we don't know what comes
	9. pass -> empty code
